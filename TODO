Still missing in the Linux port :

- Joystick and happystick support (in fact, their support is included in
that version, but I have no joystick nor happystick in order to test if it
is all right. May someone try and tell me what happened ?),
- Bug fixes that were also missing in the DOS version.
- Work properly with Esound and Alsa.
- X11 port.

If you can help, please write to @jedisct1
