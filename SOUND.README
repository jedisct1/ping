  If the sound is crappy, try the following steps :
  
- Edit sound/sound.h
- Find a line like :

#define MM_FRAGSIZE "8"

- Replace "8" with a higher value, let's say 12
- Recompile
- Try to find the smallest number that provides great sound for you.

  If the screen stays black and nothing happens when you are trying to
run the game, please check that the 'esd' daemon is not running.
